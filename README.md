# Tableau-Project
I created a Tableau Dashboard of the European Union Emissions Trading System Data. 

- To create my Tableau Dashboard, I first had to clean the data using Tableau Prep Builder.

- Next I created the Dashboard to show the Sector Analysis  by using a line graph.
- I then show the CO2 ETS emissions traded during the first three phases of the system by creating a bargraph.
- Finnaly, I showed a map comparing the countries showing which EU countries are the top CO2 emmitters and which countries are considered Green.
